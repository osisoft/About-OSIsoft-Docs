# OSIsoft Documentation

## The new source of online documentation for OCS and PI System products

Welcome to OSIsoft Documentation! This site delivers the most current versions of technical product documentation from OSIsoft, including OSIsoft Cloud Services, the PI System, and related products including software developer documentation.

The OSIsoft Documentation portal allows you to find information quickly, stay up to date with new product capabilities, and keep the documents most relevant to your daily work easily accessible. New features include:

* Fast performance
* Comprehensive search
* Integrated feedback and rating features
* Maintenance of favorite topics and sections using My Topics (requires OSIsoft Customer Portal login)
* Content update notifications through the Watchlist (requires OSIsoft Customer Portal login)
* PDF on-demand for publications and My Topics

OSIsoft Documentation provides only the latest version of official documentation for actively maintained products. When documents are updated, or incremental versions of products are released, a new version will replace the old one. The previous copy will be archived to the OSIsoft Customer Portal in PDF format. We encourage customers to upgrade and deploy the latest versions of PI System and related on-prem products to enjoy new features and operate the most secure systems available.

The [OSIsoft Customer Portal](https://my.osisoft.com/) and its [search page](https://customers.osisoft.com/s/global-search/%40uri#sort=relevancy) provide access to all current and historical technical product documents from OSIsoft in PDF format. This includes previous versions and documentation for retired products, as well as related technical and troubleshooting content from Knowledge Base articles and PI Square. Both Customer Portal and its search are accessible to customers with OSIsoft Customer Portal accounts.

A number of products are no longer actively developed and related content is not published to OSIsoft Documentation. If you are not able to find the product or feature documentation you are looking for in the OSIsoft Documentation site, check the OSIsoft Customer Portal for archived documentation.

With the launch of OSIsoft Documentation, older documentation sites will be decommissioned within the next few months, including:

* [OSIsoft Live Library](https://livelibrary.osisoft.com/LiveLibrary/web/ui.xql?action=html&resource=publist_home.html)
* [OSIsoft Developer Library](https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Documentation/PI-AF-SDK/html/1a02af4c-1bec-4804-a9ef-3c7300f5e2fc.htm)
